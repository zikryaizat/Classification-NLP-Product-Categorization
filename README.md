# Classification-NLP-Product-Categorization
Deep learning model to categorize unseen products using Tensorflow and deployed using Streamlit

**About the project**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification is a subfield of NLP that involves categorizing or assigning predefined categories or labels to a given piece of text. The goal is to automatically analyze and understand the content of the text and classify it into one or more predefined categories or classes. The model utilizes RNN-LSTM architecture implemented with the TensorFlow library and is deployed using Streamlit. Users input product descriptions, and the app categorizes them into four predefined categories: Electronics, Household, Books, or Clothing & Accessories.The code for model training and model deployment are provided.

**Result**
The result of model training accuracy and model losses are shown in graph. The model managed to achieve accuracy of 90% with 0.9 F1 score.Results of training accuracy and loss are also showned using Tensorboard.
